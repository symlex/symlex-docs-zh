# Every contribution makes a difference

We welcome contributions of any kind including pull requests, ideas, bug reports,
testing, writing documentation, tutorials and blog posts. If you help with development,
you have the opportunity to learn Symfony, PHPUnit, Vue.js and much more.

Since we are already pretty much feature-complete for our own needs, it is well possible that you won't find any open issues.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions otherwise.

## Questions? ##

Feel free to send an e-mail to [hello@symlex.org](mailto:hello@symlex.org) if you have any questions, 
need [commercial support](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/contact/) or just want to say hello.

## Pull Requests ##

Our [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/wiki/Pull-Requests) explains how to submit new features, bugfixes and documentation.

## Feature Requests ##

You are welcome to add specific feature requests directly to our main [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/issues)
or the corresponding sub-project if no similar [idea](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/idea)
or [todo](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/todo) already exists.
Please don't use the issue tracker to ask general questions.

## Reporting Bugs ##

Please use the GitHub issue tracker for [symlex/symlex](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/issues) (complete framework stack), 
[symlex/symlex-core](https://github.com/symlex/symlex-core/issues) (kernel and router) 
or the corresponding sub-project to report clearly identified bugs and impediments to us.
If you're not sure, start by asking [via email](mailto:hello@symlex.org).
When reporting an issue, please provide the version in use and information about your environment like browser, operating system, installed memory, and processor type.

## Donations ##

Please leave a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/symlex/symlex) if you like this project, it provides enough motivation to keep going.
Thank you very much! <3
