# Every contribution makes a difference

We welcome contributions of any kind including pull requests, ideas, bug reports,
testing, writing documentation, tutorials and blog posts.

Since we are already pretty much feature-complete for our own needs, it is well possible that you won't find any open issues.
Issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/help%20wanted) /
[easy](https://github.com/symlex/symlex/labels/easy) can be good (first) contributions otherwise.
