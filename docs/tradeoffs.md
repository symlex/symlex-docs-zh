# Should I use Symlex?

Give it a try if you already like Symfony and would like to work in a leaner, more agile way.

## Pros ##

  - By far the fastest PHP framework according to [phpbenchmarks.com](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com/en/)
  - Battle-tested in many large, commercial projects
  - Code and memory footprint is very small
  - Built on top of well documented and tested standard components
  - Designed to be simple with few concepts to understand
  - Easier to learn than many other frameworks
  - Using Symlex results in more maintainable and testable code that is fundamental for agile development
  - It has proven to be well suited for rapidly building microservices, CLI and single-page applications
  - It comes complete with working examples which are the best form of documentation
  - Contains everything to create full-featured Web applications: Service container, REST routing & Twig template engine
  - Plain classes are used wherever possible to avoid vendor lock-in and enable framework independent code reuse (other 
    frameworks often try to lock you in with proprietary annotations and specific base classes you have to inherit from)
  - You can use it with Symfony Components and any other PHP library out there
  - Even if you choose not to use Symlex, you might find lots of inspiration for your own projects (for example, you
    can build your own framework around the [micro-kernel](https://github.com/symlex/di-microkernel) or learn 
    how to integrate JavaScript with PHP)
  - Easy to upgrade to new versions of Symfony
  - You are free to create a fork if you want to be in full control and don't trust the community for any reason

## Cons ##

  - While you can get [commercial support](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/contact/), Symlex is not backed by a major company and has a small community:
    Development started to have a high-performance replacement for FOSRestBundle, it was never our goal to build a business
  - It is not good for developers who are not comfortable reading at least small amounts of framework code as not 
    everything is documented 100% (you're welcome to ask for help via email or send additional docs as pull request)
  - There is no support for Symfony Bundles in Symlex 
    - Using them often adds complexity to the overall architecture: They hide bootstrap / configuration details 
      and encourage to build bloated applications 
    - Symlex is designed to build focused, lean and fully testable applications
    - Writing meaningful unit tests is not possible, if certain functionality is exclusively encoded in framework 
      configuration files or magically generated by bundles
    - Acceptance tests could be created, but they are slow and not well suited for test driven development (TDD) and refactoring
  - Annotations are also not supported as we find them difficult to maintain and test
    - We prefer a tiny bit of code instead or use the service container to configure our apps
  - Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow or the Symfony documentation sometimes won't work without 
    understanding it and adapting it a little e.g. when it comes to service configuration or routing
